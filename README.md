# Velocity-Control-of-a-DC-Motor-Using-Feedback-Linearization-and-LuGre-Based-Friction-Observer
This project implements feedback linearization and a simple PI controller for precise velocity control of a brushed DC motor. Additionally, a LuGre-based observer is used to estimate and compensate for friction and external disturbances, enhancing control performance.
